# School District Analysis
Module 4

## Overview of Project

This analysis has been conducted to support the Chief Data Scientist for the School District in presenting important, focused information to the Superintendent and the School Board so that the upmost, forward thinking decisions can be made for the District's upcoming year's schools' budget and top priorities. Data sets were provided offering a detailed look into performance trends and patterns based on the student populations' standardized test scores for math and reading along with a variety of information about the schools they attend (i.e.: student funding, size, type, and budget). The completed task here shows diligent, aggregated data to provide a variety of snapshots into the results.

## Results

The District Summary provides a snapshot (below) to reflect the amount of schools located within the District, how many students attend these schools, the total budget; along with the average standardized test scores and the passing percentage based on the student population. Each student's test data and school's profile information were combined to create one unified source of data, this data was cleaned and organized to ensure that the merging of data would not cause errors in the analysis. Each student and school's contribution to the data set affect the overall outcomes as any incomplete or incorrect data would not produce accurate results.

The School Summary allows an overview of each school within the District. Each school is provided as an index and is accompanied by a variety of attributes to include the type, total student count, the school's budget, the school's per student budget, the average score of the standardized tests, and the school's percentage of those test that were of a passing grade (a 70% or higher). The attributes allow you to compare how one school attribute can affect the test scores of the students.

As reflected in the above School Summary snapshot - Thomas High School produced some of the lowest percentages of passing scores in the standardized test results. When removing the test scores of THS's 9th graders; therefore, revising the THS data to reflect 10th - 12th graders only allowed for THS to move from the lower performing schools to the 2nd highest performing school.
